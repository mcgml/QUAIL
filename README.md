# QUAIL

## Introduction

QUAIL (**qua**ntile **i**ntegral **l**inear model) is a quantile regression-based framework to estimate genetic effects on the variance of quantitative traits. QUAIL constructs a quantile integral phenotype which aggregates information from all quantile levels, and only requires fitting two linear regressions per SNP in genome-wide analysis.
